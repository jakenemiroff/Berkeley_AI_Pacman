# Berkeley AI Pacman Project

## Search

This problem is from an introductory AI class at UC Berkeley.

Here are my solution to a few of the problems in this set.

I have implemented depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms in Python.

## Multi Agent

Classic Pacman is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. 
I tried to implement multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.
